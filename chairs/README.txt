  >> KNOWN ISSUES
     1.   I'd given steve's head???
          >> Connect to internet. You need it to be able to see the head texture.
     2.   I can't remove the chair
          >> Use(default to right click) the "Chair Remover" spawn egg in the block below the chair.
             Make sure the block's hitbox is visible.
     3.   Chair's direction wrong when multiplayer
          >> You need to be the closest player from the area where you want to summon the chair.
     4.   I can't place blocks in under/front of the chair!
          >> The chair uses llama (yeah, llama!) to make it mountable, make sure you place it AFTER you placed the block :)
     5.1. I'm in survival, i tried to summon chairs in the wall but i can't.
          >> You may already know it, see CHANGELOG.txt
             You need to place the given head in the floor.
     5.2. The chair is not coming back to my inventory!!!
          >> It's already in your inventory, open your inventory and try to click every hotbar...
             I tried to fix it, though. But I can't. Maybe it's a game bug. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
     6.   My PC lags...
          >> A chair uses only two entities(and armor stand and a llama) so maybe it will lags when you place a
             hundred(or thousand) in a room, so it usually doesn't lag your PC... unless youre in a potato.
     7.   Why llamas?
          >> Hey hey, that is not an issue. I just like them.
     >> To fix errors, try type "/function deimosbtg:chairs/reset".
     >> To remove all chairs, type "/function deimosbtg:chairs/remove_all" and then click yes,
        or type "/function deimosbtg:chairs/force_remove_all" to remove without confirmation.
