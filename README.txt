  >> KNOWN ISSUES
     1.   Not worked!
          >> Use the latest version, try '/function deimosbtg:chairs/reset' to reset all advancement and scoreboard.
             It may conflict with other data/resource pack that uses minecraft:diamond_hoe as custom items..., so use it wisely.
             Or... you edit this data/resource pack to work with others! But yeah, there's a lot to change...
     2.   I'd given Steve's head???
          >> Connect to internet. You need it to be able to see the head texture.
     3.   I can't remove the chair
          >> Use(default to right click) the "Chair Remover" spawn egg in the block below the chair.
             Make sure the block's hitbox is visible.
     4.   Chair's direction wrong when multiplayer
          >> You need to be the closest player from the area where you want to summon the chair.
     5.   I can't place blocks in under/front of the chair!
          >> The chair uses llama (yeah, llama!) to make it mountable, make sure you place it AFTER you placed the block :)
     6.   Did it slow down the Minecraft performance?
          >> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ try it ;)
     7.   Why llamas?
          >> Hey hey, that is not an issue. I just like them.
     >>   To remove all chairs, type "/function deimosbtg:chairs/remove_all" and then click yes,
          or type "/function deimosbtg:chairs/force_remove_all" to remove without confirmation.
